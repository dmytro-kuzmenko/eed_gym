# artifacts

Non-versioned outputs generated by experiments:

- `runs/`: checkpoints, config snapshots, and evaluation logs produced by trainers/evaluators.
- `wandb/` (optional): local Weights & Biases cache if you enable logging.

Everything beneath this directory is safe to delete/regenerate; only this README is tracked.
